**Conventional Data Warehouse:**
- Involves copying data from transactional data stores into a relational database with a schema that's optimized for querying and building multidimensional models.

**Data Lake:**
- Highly flexible storage repository that stores large amounts of structured and unstructured data in its raw, original, and unformatted form.

**Data Lakehouse:**
- Data lakehouse solutions are used with large volumes of data in multiple formats, which is batch loaded or captured in real-time streams and stored in a data lake from which distributed processing engines like Apache Spark are used to process it.
